# Contributing to Screeps-Nooby-Typescript-Code

ðŸŽ‰ Thanks for your interest in contributing! This project is a learning-oriented Screeps AI written in TypeScript, focused on performance, clean architecture, and centralized task coordination.

Whether you're here to fix a bug, suggest improvements, or learn by doing â€” welcome!

## ðŸ§  Philosophy

This project emphasizes:
- **Explicit control**: Creeps do not make autonomous decisions; a central coordinator assigns tasks.
- **Type safety**: We rely heavily on TypeScript to catch bugs early and guide architecture.
- **Performance**: CPU efficiency matters. Avoid unnecessary `.find()` calls and re-computation.
- **Clarity over cleverness**: Prefer readable and maintainable code over obscure one-liners.
